# Book-List

A simple example of a website using in-line JavaScript and DOM manipulation to generate new List Elements while iterating through an object.

We have an object called "books" containing details about multiple books. Each book contains information about the Title, Author, Book Cover and if the book has been already read.

The JavaScript code allows us to iterate through the object "books"'s individual arrays and create new List Items dynamically.
